> Apache Pekko is an open-source framework for building applications that are concurrent, distributed, resilient and elastic. Pekko uses **the Actor Model** to provide more intuitive high-level abstractions for concurrency. Using these abstractions, Pekko also provides libraries for persistence, streams, HTTP, and more.
> 
> Pekko is a fork of Akka 2.6.x, prior to the Akka project's adoption of the Business Source License.
