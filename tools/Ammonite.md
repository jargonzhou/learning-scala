> Scala Scripting
>
> Ammonite lets you use the Scala language for scripting purposes: in the REPL or as scripts.
> - Ammonite-REPL
> A Modernized Scala REPL. With syntax highlighting, multi-line editing, the ability to load maven artifacts directly in the REPL, and many other quality-of-life improvements missing in the default Scala REPL.
> - Scala Scripts
> Lightweight Programming in Scala. Create scripts that you can run easily from the command line, without the overhead of setting up a "project" or waiting for SBT's slow startup times.
