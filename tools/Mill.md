> Mill: A Better Build Tool for Java, Scala, & Kotlin
>
> Mill is a build tool that tries to improve upon the tools traditionally used in the JVM ecosystem:
>
> - Mill builds the same Java project 3-6x faster than Maven or Gradle due to aggressive caching & parallelism
>
> - Mill’s rich featureset means less fiddling with plugins, since everything needed for development is built in
>
> - Mill builds are easily explorable in your IDE, letting you work on them without constantly googling for help
