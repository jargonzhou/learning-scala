# Scala Toolkit
* https://docs.scala-lang.org/toolkit/introduction.html

> The Scala Toolkit is a set of libraries designed to effectively perform common programming tasks. It includes tools for working with files and processes, parsing JSON, sending HTTP requests, and unit testing.

The Toolkit supports:
* Scala 3 and Scala 2
* JVM, Scala.js, and Scala Native

Use cases for the Toolkit include:
* short-lived programs running on the JVM, to scrape a website, to collect and transform data, or to fetch and process some files,
* frontend scripts that run on the browser and power your websites,
* command-line tools packaged as native binaries for instant startup
