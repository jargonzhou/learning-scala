# Cats
* https://github.com/typelevel/cats

> Cats is a library which provides abstractions for functional programming in the Scala programming language.
>
> Scala supports both object-oriented and functional programming, and this is reflected in the hybrid approach of the standard library. Cats strives to provide functional programming abstractions that are core, binary compatible, modular, approachable and efficient. A broader goal of Cats is to provide a foundation for an ecosystem of pure, typeful libraries to support functional programming in Scala applications.
> 
> Why "cats"?
>
> The name is a playful shortening of the word category, from "category theory".
