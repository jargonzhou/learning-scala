> ScalaCheck: Property-based testing for Scala
> 
> ScalaCheck is a library written in Scala and used for automated property-based testing of Scala or Java programs. ScalaCheck was originally inspired by the Haskell library *QuickCheck*, but has also ventured into its own.
>
> ScalaCheck has no external dependencies other than the Scala runtime, and works great with sbt, the Scala build tool. It is also fully integrated in the test frameworks *ScalaTest*, *specs2* and *LambdaTest*. You can also use ScalaCheck completely standalone, with its built-in test runner.
>
> ScalaCheck is used by several prominent Scala projects, for example the *Scala compiler* and the *Akka* concurrency framework.
