> Scalaz is a Scala library for functional programming.
>
> It provides purely functional data structures to complement those from the Scala standard library. It defines a set of foundational type classes (e.g. `Functor`, `Monad`) and corresponding instances for a large number of data structures.
>
> The current stable version is 7.3.8, which is cross-built against Scala 2.12.x, 2.13.x, 3.x and Scala.js, scala-native.
