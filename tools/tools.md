## Scalameta
[Scalameta](https://scalameta.org/): Library to read, analyze, transform and generate Scala programs.

* **Tree**: A core functionality of Scalameta is syntax trees, which enable you to read, analyze, transform and generate Scala programs at a level of abstraction.
* **SemanticDB**: SemanticDB is a data model for semantic information such as symbols and types about programs in Scala and other languages. SemanticDB decouples production and consumption of semantic information, establishing documented means for communication between tools.
* [Metals](./Scalameta/Metals.md): language server
* [Scalafmt](./Scalameta/Scalafmt.md): code formatter
* **Scalafix**: linting and refactoring tool
* **MUnit**: testing library
* **MDoc**: documentation tool
* **Metabrowse**: online code browser

# Typelevel
[Typelevel](./lib/Typelevel/Typelevel.md): an ecosystem of projects and a community of people united to foster an inclusive, welcoming, and safe environment around functional programming in Scala.

* [Cats](./lib/Typelevel/Cats.md): a library which provides abstractions for functional programming in the Scala programming language.
* [ScalaCheck](./lib/Typelevel/ScalaCheck.md): Property-based testing for Scala.
